#Notes App
##Description
Notes Application was built using requireJS and Semantic UI, and allows a user to create, edit, and delete notes.

The 'New Note' button allows a user to create a new note, the 'Display All' button acts as a toggle to display or hide all of the saved notes, and the 'Saved Notes' button brings up a menu allowing the user to toggle the display of individual notes. When creating a note, the user may save or discard the note. Each note also has 3 options: Edit (allows user to edit the note, with discard simply cancelling all changes made), Hide, and Delete.
